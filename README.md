## Estimate skin friction and heat transfer for turbulent boundary layers with non-ideal fluids

This repository contains the source code to estimate mean profiles and fluxes in turbulent boundary layers with non-ideal fluids using inner/outer-layer transformations.

It is based on the ideal-gas estimation in [github](https://github.com/Fluid-Dynamics-Of-Energy-Systems-Team/DragAndHeatTransferEstimation).

The source code can be used in the following ways:

  - Render the jupyter-notebook in [github](https://github.com/pcboldini/DragAndHeatTransferEstimation_NICFD/blob/main/DragAndHeatEstimate.ipynb).

  - Use the jup2py routine to convert it into a plain Python source, or download the entire github repository.
