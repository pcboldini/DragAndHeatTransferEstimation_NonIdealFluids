## Estimate skin friction and heat transfer for turbulent boundary layers with non-ideal fluids

This repository contains the source codes to estimate mean profiles and fluxes in turbulent boundary layers with non-ideal fluids using inner/outer-layer transformations.

The source code can be used in the following ways:


  - Render the jupyter-notebook in [github](https://github.com/pcboldini/DragAndHeatTransferEstimation_NICFD/DragAndHeatEstimate.ipynb).


  - Use the jup2py routine to convert it into a plain Python source, or download the entire github repository.
