## Estimating Skin Friction and Heat Transfer in Turbulent Boundary Layers with Non-Ideal Fluids

This repository provides source code to estimate mean profiles and wall fluxes (skin friction and heat transfer) in turbulent boundary layers involving **non-ideal fluids**, using **inner- and outer-layer transformations**.

It extends the ideal-gas-based method originally introduced in:

> Hasan, A. M., Larsson, J., Pirozzoli, S., & Pecnik, R. (2024).  
> *Estimating mean profiles and fluxes in high-speed turbulent boundary layers using inner/outer-layer scalings.* AIAA Journal, 62(2), 848â€“853.

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

You can use the provided tools in the following ways:

- **Interactive Analysis**:  
  Open and run the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/pcboldini/DragAndHeatTransferEstimation_NICFD/blob/main/DragAndHeatEstimate.ipynb) directly in GitHub or in your preferred local environment (e.g. JupyterLab or VSCode).

- **Convert to Plain Python**:  
  Use the `jup2py` utility to convert the notebook into a standard `.py` file, or download this repository to access all source files.
